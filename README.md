I was provided the following brief for the project.

---------------------
Welford Landing Page
---------------------

We have attached an asset folder, in it you will find a design and images used. Please download the asset folder here:  https://wetransfer.com/downloads/8ec35ff9f19591eafee7d734fd0a4d4520190515132011/229b326cf8ccf8a27926fed120368a2920190515132011/d3cae1

Your brief is to use this design and make it responsive. This test will help us evaluate your current skill set, your ability to follow orders, your timeliness and your eye for detail.

Guidance:
-Build the design in HTML & CSS
-Design MUST be responsive
-You can use a font of your choosing
-The mobile layout is to your preference
-Links can be /#

Bonus Points:
- If Sass is used
- If a build tool is used (e.g gulp)

Set Up & Share Guide:
- Create a repo on GitHub
- Send a link to jobs@welfordmedia.co.uk once completed.
